Toronto-3D is a large-scale urban outdoor point cloud dataset acquired by an MLS system in Toronto, Canada for semantic segmentation. This dataset covers approximately 1 km of point clouds and consists of about 78.3 million points with 8 labeled object classes: Road (label 1), Road marking (label 2), Natural (label 3), Building (label 4), Utility line (label 5), Pole (label 6), Car (label 7), Fence (label 8), unclassified (label 0).

Details on the dataset can be found at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08284).

Toronto-3D belongs to [Mobile Sensing and Geodata Science Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/mobile-sensing/), University of Waterloo. 

Teledyne Optech is acknowledged for providing mobile LiDAR point cloud data. Thanks Jing Du and Dr. Guorong Cai from Jimei University for point cloud labeling.
